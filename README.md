# Cups docker image

## Description

This is a WIP docker image. I am publishing it now so if anyone else has a use for it they can modify it for their use.

If you have a suggestion for how to improve usability of this image, feel free to post on the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/jacobalberty/cups-docker/issues).


## Volumes:
